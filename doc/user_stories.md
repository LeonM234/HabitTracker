# USER STORIES

## Logging In

As a _user_ in order to _log into the website_ I want to _sign in with my username and password_.

The user clicks the login button and is redirected to the login page.  User enters email and password and then clicks login.  If user has already registered, he is logged in, if not, he is given an error and told to try again (maybe he typed in email wrong or password wrong).  Error will also tell user that if he hasn’t registered, then the user should do that first.  User clicks register button (located on login page).  User enters email he wishes to use, password he wishes to use twice, once for initializing password, the second for confirming.  User clicks register button once information is filled in, and is now both registered and logged in.

## Add a Habit

As a _user_ in order to _start a new habit_ I want to _create the habit to track over time_.

User clicks new habit button (located on all pages).  User is redirected to new habit form (located on the “Habit Tracker” page).  

User chooses between (1) adding own habit, or (2) selecting a predefined one:  
(1) User enters the name of the habit in the form box  
(1) User selects a category for the habit from a drop down box  
(1) User selects a difficulty level for the habit from a drop down box
(1) User clicks Add/Save Habit button  
(2) User selects from either the “Suggested Habits” dropdown menu, or the “Habit Stack” dropdown menu.  
(2) User selects from one of a list of various pre-defined habits  
(2) Category / Difficulty / Task Name are autofilled as they are predefined  
(2) User clicks Add/Save Habit button  

## Check Progess of All Habits

As a _user_ in order to _track all of my progress_ I want to _have the progress displayed to me_.

The user will click on the "progress statistics" tab.  This will redirect the user to that page.  User will then have graphs displaying the overall progress of his/her various habits.  The user can then use various filters to change the display of the graph based on time, category, or difficulty of habit.

## Check Individual Habit Progress

As a _user_ in order to _track the progress of a single habit_ I want to _have the progress displayed to me_.

The user navigates to the "Habits" page via a tab.  Individual habits the user has picked are displayed to the user via icons.  Clicking an icon will result in a drop down display appearing. In the drop down are three tabs, one with the current progress of the user on that particular habit.

## Mark a Habit Completed for the Day

As a _user_ in order to _mark the completion of a habit/task for the day_ I want to _enter in the completed task_.

The user navigates to the "Habits" page via a tab.  Individual habits the user has picked are displayed to the user via icons.  Clicking an icon will result
in a drop down display appearing.  In the drop down are three tabs, one with the ability to select "Habit/Task Completed for the Day".  User clicks this option to input a completed task for the day.
